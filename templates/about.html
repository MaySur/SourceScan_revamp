        <p>In the year 2022, it is evident that news stories are no longer limited to mainstream news sources. With the vast amount of information available on the internet, breaking news often surfaces on online message boards such as Reddit, directly from the source, before reaching mainstream network news channels. However, gathering information from the internet can prove to be a daunting task for individuals, given the sheer amount of news available from numerous places on the internet.</p>

                API Reddit Scraper: Designed in Python language, this component takes a list of predetermined 'news source' subreddits, such as r/news, r/global news, and r/politics, and uses keywords provided by the user to gather all pertinent information surrounding the provided topic. The scraper's aim is to filter out irrelevant posts and provide only relevant submissions from each news-based subreddit.

                MySQL Database: The MySQL database is designed around the concept of key terms inputted by the client and holds the gathered information after it is filtered. This database is called after the use of the scraper, and is needed for the WebUIâ€™s query, in order to return the results to the user.

                HTML User Interface (WebUI): The WebUI component provides users with an easy-to-use interface, enabling them to filter information and display only relevant submissions. The WebUI queries the database after the scraper is deployed, returning submissions to the user that they can then view the details of.
